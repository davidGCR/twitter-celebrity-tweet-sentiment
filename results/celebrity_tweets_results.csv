TheRock,@grahamflanagan Possibly buddy but I wouldn’t take that risk in the summer with families. Denzel can go rated R with Equalizer2 this weekend since it’s an established IP. Truth is Skyscraper was always only a two quad film I tried to expand but ultimately couldn’t (thus the $25m opening).,0
